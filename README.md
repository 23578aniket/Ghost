This project is created using various machine learning techniques and you can also download and use this project.
But first, make sure to install all the liberaries from each module that are used and run them in virtual environment.
Also this project lacks dataset to train the model but I have used my own set of commands to train the model.
As a result, this project is just a framework for developing the actual functional AI assistant, just add the dataset and train the model.
This project sooley works on intent prediction, if the predicted intent is >= 60% than it will perform tasks otherwise it will ask you to repeat again
or just search the query on chrome.
More projects are coming soon.
Till than 
ENJOY....

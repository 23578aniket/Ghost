Born as Hirdesh Singh on March 15, 1983, in Hoshiarpur, Punjab, India, he gained widespread recognition in the late 2000s and early 2010s with his unique style and lyrics that often revolve around themes of love, relationships, and partying. His rise to fame can be attributed to his debut album \"International Villager\" released in 2011, which was a commercial success and earned him several awards, including the 2012 Brit Asia TV Music Awards for Best Male Act and Best Album.\n\nInterestingly, Honey Singh's music style is often compared to that of Malkit Singh, a British-Indian bhangra singer, known for his energetic live performances. Honey Singh's music often incorporates elements of bhangra, hip-hop, and electronic dance music, which has contributed to his massive fan following, particularly among the younger generation. Moreover, it is worth noting that Honey Singh has also ventured into acting, making his Bollywood debut in 2014 with the film \"The Xpose\", alongside Himesh Reshammiya and Zoya Afroz. According to Wikipedia, Singh has been open about his struggles with bipolar disorder and has used his platform to raise awareness about mental health issues."

He is a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the ideologue of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). Modi rose to prominence as the Chief Minister of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014.\n\nDuring his tenure, Gujarat saw significant economic development, which earned him the reputation of being a pro-business and pro-development leader. Modi's leadership and vision for India's growth and development led to his landslide victory in the 2014 Indian general election, making him the first non-Congress prime minister to win a majority in the Lok Sabha. He has been re-elected as the Prime Minister in 2019, winning a second term.\n\nModi was born on September 17, 1950, in Vadnagar, a small town in Gujarat. His early life was marked by poverty and hardship. He joined the RSS at a young age and later became a full-time pracharak (propagator) in the RSS.\n\nModi's entry into politics was marked by his appointment as the general secretary of the BJP in Gujarat in 1988.
